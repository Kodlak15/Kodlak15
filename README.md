# About me
I am a self-taught developer and co-founder of Cascade Web Services, a small web services business. My main priority at the moment is getting my business off the ground, but I have also been spending a considerable amount of time recently studying cybersecurity and the Rust programming language. 

If you need to contact me for any reason, please send me an email: stanlcod15@gmail.com
