Icons Per Line

You can specify how many icons you would like per line! It's an optional argument, and the default is 15.

Change the &perline=3 to any number between 1 and 50.

Centering Icons

Want to center the icons in your readme? The SVGs are automatically resized, so you can do it the same way you'd normally center an image.

Hi! My name is Cody Stanley. I am a self-taught developer located near Seattle, WA. I love solving problems and am always working to become a better problem solver. I am passionate about AI, software and web development, statistics, and other related subjects. I find great satisfaction in discovering hidden insights in data, helping others better understand and interpret data, and building tools that make life and work more efficient. 

I am eagerly looking for collaboration opportunities and/or freelance work. If you believe I can help you in any way, or if you would like to get ahold of me for any reason, feel free to send me an email and we can discuss! -> standlcod15@gmail.com
