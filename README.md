# About me
Hi! My name is Cody Stanley. I am a self-taught developer located near Seattle, WA. I love solving problems and am always working to become a better problem solver. I am passionate about AI, software and web development, statistics, and other related subjects. I find great satisfaction in discovering hidden insights in data, helping others better understand and interpret data, and building tools that make life and work more efficient. 

I am eagerly looking for collaboration opportunities and/or freelance work. If you believe I can help you in any way, or if you would like to get ahold of me for any reason, feel free to send me an email and we can discuss! -> standlcod15@gmail.com
