- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kodlak15 aka Cody Stanley. 
- 👀 I am interested in data science, machine learning, math/statistics, software engineering/development, and finding ways to automate all sorts of tasks. My academic background is in earth science and GIS. I am very insterested in opportunities to apply my skills to the earth and atmospheric sciences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything! I spend the majority of my time learning working with data science oriented projects in Python, but have been learning C++, JS, and SQL on the side. 
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on all sorts of projects, feel free to reach out at my email below!
